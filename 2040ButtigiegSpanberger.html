The group originated from a social media page titled "<a href="#" style="color: #0645ad;">Democrats for a Second Civil War</a>."</p>
    <p>Their platform is characterized by a call for aggressive action against insurgents and suspicion of <a href="#" style="color: #0645ad;">Republican leaders</a>, some of whom they accuse of collusion or tacit support for the insurgency. The War Democrats advocate for expansive federal powers, including military interventions on U.S. soil, to crush the insurgency and restore order, positioning themselves as the party's hawkish, security-focused wing.</p>
    <p>The faction has grown more influential in shaping the Democratic Party's security policies since its inception, though it has also sparked internal debates regarding the balance between security measures and civil liberties.</p>
